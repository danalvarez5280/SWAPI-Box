# SWAPI Box

### The concept behind this project is nest API fetch calls. Using Promises, particularly Promis.All to fetch information from a Star Wars API that will itself have values that are API urls that will need to fetched inside the inital fetch.

### We used React.JS, CSS3 for the Front End of this site.

### We use the Star Wars API for all the data. 

### One glaring item we never fully finished was the CSS. We spent too much time on trying to test the nested fetch calls with no success. 

### Since then, new testing methods exist for React and specifically testing API calls.

#### We will need to go back and adjust the testing files and CSS files.
